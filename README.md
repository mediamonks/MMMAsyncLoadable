## Usage

‚ùïThis documentation is built with the assumption that you're already aware
of `MMMLoadable`. If you're not, head over to the [MMMLoadable](https://github.com/mediamonks/MMMLoadable)
page for more information.

### AsyncLoadable

An async loadable makes it possible to fetch the content `C` using the
async/await syntax. `AsyncLoadable` is a concrete implementation of
`AsyncLoadableProtocol`, subclass `AsyncLoadable` to make your own loadable, so
you can avoid working with generics "down the line".

`AsyncLoadable<C>` requires that your `MMMLoadable` 'contents' is a single
concrete type `C`. So if your loadable loads multiple values, either pass a
`tuple` (recommended up to 2 values) or a wrapping `struct`.

It introduces 2 new methods, `fetch()` and `fetchIfNeeded()`.

**Simple example:**

```swift
public final class UserLoadable: AsyncLoadable<UserData> {
    
    public override func doSync() {
        
        client.fetchUser { [weak self] result in
            
	    guard let self = self else { return }
	    
	    switch result {
	    case .success(let user):
	        // This will set the state to `didSyncSuccessfully` and
		// populate the `content` property.
	        self.setDidSyncSuccessfullyWithContent(user)
	    case .failed(let error):
	        // This will set the state to `didFailToSync` and
		// populate the `error` property.
	        self.setFailedToSyncWithError(error)
	    }
	}
    }
}

// At the call-site:
let loadable = UserLoadable()
let user = try await loadable.fetch() // This is your `content`, or it will throw the `error`.
```

#### Fetch

```swift
func fetch() async throws -> C
```
Fetch the content asynchronously, instead of adding a listener, this will 
throw upon `setFailedWithError` and return the content when `setDidSyncSuccessfully`.

Equivalent of `MMMLoadable/sync()`.

#### Fetch if needed

```swift
func fetchIfNeeded() async throws -> C
```

Similar to `fetch()`, only when `MMMPureLoadableProtocol/needsSync()` is `true`.

Equivalent of `MMMLoadable/syncIfNeeded()`.

#### Map

```swift
func map<T>(_ transform: @escaping (C) throws -> T) -> AsyncLoadable<T>
```

Map a `AsyncLoadable<C>` into `AsyncLoadable<T>` by supplying a closure that
maps `C` into `T`. This is helpful if you want to quickly map a loadable from a
"thin" to a "fat" model without creating unnecessary `MMMLoadableProxy`s.
E.g. `AsyncLoadable<API.User>` into `AsyncLoadable<Models.User>`.

If the original loadable is already synced / has contents available, we map it
directly.

If there is an error thrown in the callback, we use that as the new
`AsyncLoadable/error` and set it to failed.

**Example**
```swift
func fetchUser() -> AsyncLoadable<Models.User> {
    // apiClient.getUser() returns AsyncLoadable<API.User>
    apiClient.getUser().map { apiUser in
        return Models.User(apiModel: apiUser)
    }
}
```

#### AsyncMap

```swift
func asyncMap<T>(_ transform: @escaping (C) async throws -> T) -> AsyncLoadable<T>
```

Map a `AsyncLoadable<C>` into `AsyncLoadable<T>` by supplying a `async` closure
that maps `C` into `T`. This is similar to `map` but allows to take a `async`
closure, downside of this is that it won't directly map the loadable if content
is available, so you'll have to make sure to sync it again.

If there is an error thrown in the callback, we use that as the new
`AsyncLoadable/error` and set it to failed.

**Example**
```swift
func fetchUser() -> AsyncLoadable<Models.User> {
    // apiClient.getUser() returns AsyncLoadable<API.User>
    apiClient.getUser().asyncMap { apiUser in
        try await Models.FetchUser(apiModel: apiUser)
    }
}
```

#### FlatMap

```swift
func flatMap<T>(_ transform: @escaping (C) async throws -> AsyncLoadable<T>) -> AsyncLoadable<T>
```

FlatMap a `AsyncLoadable<C>` into `AsyncLoadable<T>` by supplying a closure that
maps `C` into `AsyncLoadable<T>`. This is helpful if you want to chain loadables
without having to observe each one.

For example say you have `LoadableA` that upon success will load `LoadableB`
using a value in it's contents, `LoadableB` will be exposed to the users, since
that only contains valuable info for them. If `LoadableA` fails, we don't have
to try to load `LoadableB`.

If there is an error thrown in the callback, we use that as the new
`AsyncLoadable/error` and set it to failed.

**Please note** that unlike the map function, that doesn't take an async closure,
if the content is available, we don't map it directly, you will have to sync the
loadable again. The original loadable won't ever sync again if content is
available, you will have to call `sync` manually to do that.

**Example**
```swift
func fetchLoadableB() -> AsyncLoadable<BValue> {
    loadableA().flatMap { aVal in
        return LoadableB(identifier: aVal.identifier)
    }
}
```

#### Joined

```swift
func joined<T>(_ transform: @escaping (C) async throws -> AsyncLoadable<T>) -> AsyncLoadable<(C, T)>
```

Join two `AsyncLoadable`s together, from `AsyncLoadable<C>` and `AsyncLoadable<T>`
to a `AsyncLoadable<(C, T)>`. This could come in useful when you want to grab
data from `C` to construct your loadable `T` without losing `C`.

This behaves the same as `AsyncLoadable/flatMap(_:)`.

**Example**
```swift
func fetchLoadableB() -> AsyncLoadable<(AValue, BValue)> {
    loadableA().joined { aVal in
        return LoadableB(identifier: aVal.identifier)
    }
}
```

### AsyncLoadableObserver

`MMMLoadableObserver` that supports an asynchronous closure as it's callback. Or use
the `loadable.sink { loadable in ... }` shorthand and pass an async closure.

### AsyncLoadableStream

Listen to an `AsyncLoadable` by using an `AsyncStream`. This allows you to
iterate over the `AsyncLoadableStream/iterator`, this will stream a new
`AsyncLoadableStreamObject` on every change in the loadable.

For example:

```swift
class MyView: UIView {

    private let loadable: AsyncLoadable<MyData>

    // It's crucial that we call `finish()` somehow, this is also called upon
    // deinit, so storing it as a property is an easy way to accomplish this.
    private var stream: AsyncLoadableStream<MyData>?

    public init(loadable: AsyncLoadable<MyData>) {

        let stream = AsyncLoadableStream(loadable)
	
        self.loadable = loadable
        self.stream = stream

        for await obj in stream.iterator {
            // Do something with the stream object, e.g. update UI.
            updateUI()
        }
    }

    private func updateUI() {
        loader.isHidden = loadable.loadableState != .syncing
    }
}
```

**Please note** that due to the nature of `async/await` in swift it's crucial to
store the stream as a local (private) property to ensure that
`AsyncLoadableStream/finish()` get's called upon `deinit`. This stops the
stream. Otherwise your `Actor` will get blocked indefinitely, since it will keep
on waiting for new values, causing a memory leak.
